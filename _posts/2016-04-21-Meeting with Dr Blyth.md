_Short meeting between Calvin and Dr Blyth_

Main issue is lack of a way to select subregions and the ability to do analysis on that.
Once that functionality is implemented we can focus on what analysis to do.
Things that would be interesting to see for the region:

* mean  
* std deviation  
* min  
* max  
* sum  

Would also like to flatten the data so once selected a subregion sum along all depth. (Get info like mass of galaxy, velocity etc)

Other things to think about:

* CAVASS needs to be constantly adjusted to see stuff, outliers mess it up  
* given a selection would be nice to see histogram of pixel values, fit gaussian to histogram  
  * can see what's not noise  
* can estimate some information based on distance between horns  
* would be nice for things to render faster (save lower res versions?)
