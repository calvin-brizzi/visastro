# First Meeting
We're lucky and unlucky at the same time. Lots to choose from makes it harder to choose. Should start exploring what's out there before committing to anything.

Bryce and Laurisha are keen to work on visualization aspect, Calvin on algorithmic backend/analysis possibly using GPGPU.

Best move is starting with past year's paper and work through their references and those references' references.

Main objective for next week is a skeleton of the lit review (a contents table, but more detailed.)

Visualization people should focus on surface visualizations, comparing radio and optical data, tagging and selecting. Should start lit review together, but focus on different things.

More meetings need to be planned with Sarah Blythe, for exactly what kind of things people need.

Meeting again on Monday, skeleton's done.
